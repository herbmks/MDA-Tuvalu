### Repository info

In the root of the repository are all the files (notebook and scripts) for data cleaning, exploratory data analyses, and modelling. All the python3 packages necessary to run these notebooks are in the requirements.txt file.

There are three folders. The "raw data" includes the raw data, to which the data cleaning and preprocessing is applied. The cleaned and preprocessed data is stored on the "clean data folder".

Finally, the dash folder includes all the files necessary for the dash app. This includes the data, the scripts, the assets, and a requirements.txt file specific to the app. This app is deployed on https://www.mda-tuvalu.herokuapp.com/.
